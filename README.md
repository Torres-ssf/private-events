# Project: Private Events (Ruby on Rails)

This is the sixth project of the Main Rails curriculum at [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) - @microverseinc

  - The objective is to build a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users.
- The main focus will be on data and function as there will be less focus on the styling
